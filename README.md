## Playing with some swift concepts

> XCode does not support running console programs with alternative file names from the usual main.swift

> Therefore to run this code you will need to use the terminal

```
$ cd swift-basics/swift-basics
$ swift <file-name>.swift

//e.g
swift main.swift 
// this will run the main.swift file
```

## Swift Reference Types(Classes) Vs Value Types(Structures and Enumerations)

> Classes are references types while atructures and enumerations are value types.A value type is a type whose value is copied when it's assigned to a variable or constant. Classes are reference types. Unlike value types, reference types are not copied when they are assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function. Rather than a copy a referebce to the same existing instance is used.ref
