# Swift Code Lab
## Playing with some swift concepts

> XCode does not support running console programs with alternative file names from the usual main.swift

> Therefore to run this code you will need to use the terminal

```
$ cd swift-basics/swift-basics
$ swift <file-name>.swift

//e.g
swift main.swift 
// this will run the main.swift file
```
